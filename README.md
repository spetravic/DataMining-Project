# CS-E4650 Methods of Data Mining - Final Project

#### Task: preprocess and cluster text data using methods learnt in the course: K-Means and spectral clustering.

The data consists of abstracts of scientific papers, together with paper titles and class numbers (reflecting the topic category). The data format is the following: id#class#title#abstract where # is a field separator, id is a document identifier, class is the class number 1-5 (reflecting the topic), and title and abstract are text fields.

#### Processing steps:
1. Tokenization
2. Removing stopwords
3. Stemming
4. Representation as TF-IDF
5. Clustering
